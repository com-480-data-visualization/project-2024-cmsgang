## Overview
Our visualization consists of a web application designed to allow users to search, filter, sort, and play songs. The interface includes search functionality, multiple filters for song attributes, sorting options, and an audio player for previewing tracks.

## Technical Setup

### Files and Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the HTML elements.
- `csvManipulator.js`: The JavaScript file that handles data manipulation, filtering, sorting, and event handling.
- `spotifyAPI.js`: The JavaScript file to interact with Spotify API for fetching track details (not detailed here).
- `Images/`: Directory containing images used in the application (e.g., play/pause buttons, sort arrows).
- `vids/`: Directory containing videos for the stickman dances.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a web server setup to serve the files (e.g., using VS Code Live Server extension or any other local server).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
