## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)


### Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julianoorlandi/spotify-top-songs-and-audio-features/data

Our dataset contains the songs from the top 200 charts on Spotify for each year since 2016, their respective artists and number of streams, as well as the audio features of each song. The dataset is updated regularly (with new charts data), and the latest update at the time of writting this was carried out on march 10th. 

The data is complete and requires very little preprocessing or cleaning, and can be worked with directly for the most part.

A closer look at the dataset and an explanation is carried out in the "EDA" interactive notebook found in the "milestone 1" file on this repository. However we can give a brief overview of the dataset.

As of March 10th 2024, there are currently 6513 entries in the dataset, each entry represents a track, with its associated artists, spotify statistics such as number of streams, the number of weeks on the top charts, and then a few very interesting descrpitive and musical features such as" "key", "energy", "danceability", time signature and many others which are further explored in the python notebook. 


### Problematic

The aim of our visualization is to present various characteristics of a selected song in a fun and appealing way (using a dancing crowd animation). Simultaneously, the measures of these characteristics will be shown in a sound-wave-bars style and on a DJ control table and a snippet of the song played. Additionally, artists’ average characteristics can be presented in the exact same fashion, which becomes interesting when trying to evaluate an artists’ general style.

Where this visualization set-up becomes interesting is with the inverse option of manipulating the said DJ table. Multiple buttons and sliders, corresponding to the different characteristics can be adjusted by the user, and corresponding songs (or artists’ averages) automatically presented in the exact same way. This allows the user to find songs (or artists) based on specific desired criterias and their specific combinations, like a measure of their “danceability” for example. 

We think that through this project we can create a tool allowing a new way of analyzing songs and artists on the one hand, and discovering new songs and artists on the other. All of that wrapped in a single, easy to use and to understand, fun and visually appealing frame.
Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

The target audience ranges from a child wanting to play around with his favorite songs and understand how a crowd could be reacting to them, to professional DJs looking for songs fitting into very specific criterias.

Our motivation stems from wanting to understand the meaning of the datasets’ variables and evolved into wanting to make practical use of these characteristics. For that purpose, an instinctive and interactive visual representation is needed, which we will aim to design. Instead of relying on genres, stereotypes, albums and specific playlists, we want to find a completely different approach to present songs and artists. Hopefully, this can lead to unexpected discoveries and maybe one day generalize to include more songs than the Top 200 Spotify songs since 2016 that are provided in our selected dataset.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
